# Hello-World

Hello World

My name is Hunter.

I love to play video games and I decided I want to try to figure out how they work and how I can try to mkae some of my own.
My favorite video games are the Call of Duty series, as I get very involved into the campaign, and the multiplayer is a fun thing to do when I'm bored.
I also love to watch T.V. One of my favorite shows is 'The Umbrella Academy', a show about kids who have super powers. It's pretty interesting.
For sports, I run Cross Country, I play basketball, volleyball, and soccer.
